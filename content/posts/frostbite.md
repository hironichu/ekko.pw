Hello my fellow friends, I wanted to share with you the work i have been doing on this little project
called Frostbite.

Last October I started working on a game named Frosbite, a game that is made to run in browser, without any specific software other than a web browser, I am not gonna go into details about the story and the game itself today but today is important because I shared the source code publicly, and this
is for me really special as I didn't wanted to share my sh*ty looking code and also, I don't wanted
to share something that wasn't working (the game isn't made yet)

-------------------------------------

You can find just bellow the link of the source code :

https://github.com/hironichu/FrostbiteGame

>note that the source code isn't the one I use in my workflow, this one is clean of useless stuff I make.

And, if you wish to run the """"game"""" for yourself, you can find here the link of the live-running version :

https://frostbite.ekko.pw/

>like I said, there is Absolutely NOTHING working, don't post issues relating to this, if you do want to help, please just be helpful and kind.

I am currently working on a way to load Forks and Branches out of the live game, this will be fun because it will allow you to run your own version of the game inside the real version.

I will be sharing way more now and then, the next post about Frostbite will be about the storyline


Thanks for reading and looking into this, It really means a lot to me.
