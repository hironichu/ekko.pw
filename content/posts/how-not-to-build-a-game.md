# You know it's hard to create a game right?

Let me tell you a story, it's a short one. The story of someone who want to build a game, from scratch, with no library `(or the less amount of external existing ressources)` but actually get stuck on every system he implement.

Well that's me, and if you are reading this it means you are probably interested in my work.

## Dev log #1

---
Where can I start, what can I say, well the game is not there (for obvious reasons) and as I am still building the core code of the product, there ain't much I can really show.
Like a friend of mine said, I building a Menu engine not a game Engine 😒

Take a look at the first screen you'll see when entering the game (not exactly the first, but kinda)

I did not set a color patern YET. so the colors here are just for the feel but certainly not the one that will be used, same for the buttons, and for the font (basically everything)

> This is not representative of the final look/feel of the product, it’s a prototype.

Because the game will have the least ammount of unnecessary screen and interfaces, I want to build something that will have the best user experience possible, I don't want too much buttons, too much menu/submenus etc.. in a way, there should not be any sub menu in the game as it breaks the user experience imo.

### Roadmap `(? What)`

When I started this project, I made somewhat of a roadmap on Notion, I kept as much as I could track of what I wanted to make, what was planned and blablabla, in short I fucked up.

But it's still relevent to this days, I don't want to go into much details on the Notion document itself, so the card are very brief on what is in the work/planned/paused etc

> You can find the roadmap here :

### Someone said SPONSORS ? 

Yes, I have been accepted in the github Sponsor program, so if you'd like to give a tiny bit of support you can by clicking on this tiny cute button down here
{{< sponsor >}}

Frostbite has been at the top of my priorities, basically working sometimes 20hours no-stop on it, making from the code to the sprites or audio or design, I am building from scratch everything.

(that's the catchy phrase that is supposed to help me giving you a reason to support my work, but you do you ! I don't mind, even sharing is free and it's helping! )

### What's next ?

I will try to post real content when the game is gonna take form, even streaming live the progression of the game.

I wanted also share right now, that due to the changes of the nature of the game (Not being Solo player only), not all the game is gonna be Open sourced, some part will be as part of the modding possibilities that I want to add, but the server, and some of the client code will remain private and obfuscated on release version.

The reason being : Security and Privacy.

I don't want bad players digging through the code to know all the quests, or stories, or even just the securty logic for the sake of the game and other players, however, after few months after release, there will be changes to this.
